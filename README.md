# expressMVC
A sample app using Node and Express. 

This is a primitive Hello World style app. 

Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QseHOX-5nJQ

To run this, install Node JS first (https://nodejs.org)

Then clone this in your local machine or virtual box, where you have installed it.

Cloning would ensure Node module are downloaded too.

Run the `app.js` file with `$ node app.js`

I was running it on Nitrous (https://nitrous.io), so port is set at 3000.
